The R package classifies the radar echoes using the wavelet scale analysis. The รก trous wavelet transform is used to separate convective
scale features from the smooth stratiform field. Radar echoes are labeled with three 
categories 1. Stratiform class, 2. convective class and 3. an
intermediate class.
