## PyREClass

The R package classifies the radar reflectivity data using Wavelet scale analysis. 
The á trous wavelet transform is used to separate convective scale features from the smooth stratiform field. 
Radar echoes are labeled with three  categories 1. Stratiform class, 2. Convective class and 3. an Intermediate class.
Check PDF documentation for function detail.

## Description

A new method for separating convective, intermediate, and stratiform rainfall based on the wavelet scale analysis. The method uses *à trous* wavelet transform (WT) to separate heterogeneous convective features from the relatively smooth stratiform field. The heterogeneous region is further split into a convective class for the large wavelet coefficients and an intermediate class for the small wavelet coefficients. There is an improvement in the estimation of convective-stratiform fraction and frequency distribution of rain rates in comparison to the well established Steiner method. This new method correctly reclassified a significant fraction of Steiner’s convective regions.
